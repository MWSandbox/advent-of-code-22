# My solution for Advent of Code 2022 <!-- omit in toc -->

This repo contains my solution for the Advent of Code 2022. The Advent of Code is an advent calendar containing little programming puzzles each day. For more information: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about.

My goal for the Advent of Code was to learn Go, a programming language I haven't used so far.

I have added some comments and ratings for the puzzles below, you will also find screenshots whenever I've implemented a visual solution.

| **Comment**               | I liked this puzzle a lot, it was nice to code and didn't take much time - a good ending to the advent of code. I'm saving the SNAFU numbers in an array, each entry representing a digit. When converting to int I can just multiply the value to the power of the index of the digit and sum up all values for all digits. For the other way around I'm converting the decimal number to a number of base 5 using Go's strconv. Then I iterate over all digits and if a digit is higher than 2 (highest SNAFU digit) I will turn it to a negative digit and increase the following digit instead. |
| **Screenshots**           | Left side of the table represents the SNAFU numbers, each digit to the base of 5. "-" equals value "-1" and "=" equals "-2". <br /> ![Conversion](docs/Puzzle25-visual.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Comment**               | My solution is a little slow, so I'm not completely happy with it, but it is returning the right results. I'm using a priority queue to find the next path I want to investigate. Priority is given by the shortest path length, if there are multiple paths with shortest length then the one with shortest distance to the target is chosen. For each path I'm detecting if a blizzard is moving to an adjacent tile or to the tile the actor is currently standing on. Based on that information the remaining possible paths are added to the queue. I'm using a cantor hash function to only look for paths that haven't been investigated at the same time and position already. |
| **Screenshots**           | Screenshot display the valley with its borders (#). At the top left corner is the starting spot and at the bottom right the target tile. The actor is marked as E and is currently facing the target tile. Blizzards are marked based on the direction they are moving. If multiple blizzards are located on the same tile the blizzard count is given. Dots represent empty tiles. <br /> ![Valley](docs/Puzzle24-visual.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Ideas for improvement** | - The algorithm is pretty slow and requires many seconds until it returns the results. Therefore I would try to improve the performance next by using a better priority algorithm or reducing the available paths                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Comment**               | After the difficult day 22, this puzzle was much easier. I extended the cave dynamically whenever need (once an elf touches its boundaries) and implemented an array of movement functions that got reordered after every round.             |

| **Ideas for improvement** | - Instead of re-allocating the cave size as necessary, it would be possible to allocate a cave size large enough for all elves. That would mean that the array size is larger than required, but it does not need to be extended that often. |

| **Puzzle summary**        | A cube needs to be folded based on a 2D blueprint. This cube represents a 3D labyrinth. An actor needs to move through the labyrinth given a list of instructions and when walking over the edge from one cube side to another, the actor will get rotated based on the folding pattern.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Comment**               | I like the puzzle, but it was very tough and took way too much time to implement. First I tried to implement a folding algorithm that could parse any input given. This was more complicated than initially expected and my code got more and more messy. Therefore I did a reset and hardcoded the cube setup based on my personal input. Getting the cube setup and all transitions right took a lot of time on its own. |

| **Ideas for improvement** | - Code is still a bit messy and could use some refactorings. The transitions between cube sides can be solved with less code.<br />- My implementation works only for my input since I didn't parse the cube folding -> A cube folding algorithm would be a great extension                                                                                                                                                |

| **Comment**               | I built a binary tree, each node representing an equation and the children its left and right operands. Walking through the tree bottom up, it was easy to calculate the result of each node up to the root node. When one of the values has gone missing, I could walk the tree top to bottom and for each node check if the missing value is in the left or right subtree - then re-calculating the expected value of the corresponding child by solving the equation for the missing variable. |

| **Puzzle summary**        | An optimization problem during the production of robots. Each robot produces parts for the next better robot to be built and the production of robots needs to be scheduled for best possible output. Due to the large variety of options, a brute force approach is not possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Comment**               | This puzzle reminded me a of the Factorio game. My solutions looks a little more complicated than it might need to. I've added a lot of different filters to reduce the possible production paths and therefore the execution time. The algorithm runs very fast now. However, there might be types of input where the filtering is too strict, but I think it should work with most inputs:<br />- Don't create new robots for resources when you already have enough to create all other robots<br />- Don't create new robots for a resource (besides geode) if you don't have enough time left to spent these resources<br />- If geode robots can be built -> build it<br />- If there is already a path where geode robots have been built earlier -> stop the current path |

| **Comment**               | First part was very easy to solve, second part not so much. I'm using an approach to iterate through air drops connected with the surrounding cubes in at least 3 directions. For each drop I check if it is part of a larger air chamber and check for the content of the chamber if there is a way out of the surrounding cubes or if it is trapped inside. Once an air chamber has been found, the containing air drops will not be checked again. Hash values are used for faster lookup. |

| **Puzzle summary**        | Calculate the block tower height in a tetris-like game after a lot of moves.

| **Comment**               | I love tetris and therefore loved this puzzle as well. Since I was too lazy to figure out a formula to calculate the tower height, my solution dynamically detects repetition patterns and extrapolates the final solution base on that. I'm happy with the code I've written, I think it's easy to read and even provides the option to print the current game state. |

| **Comment**               | This was very tough and took me a while of debugging until I found out that an array has not been initialized correctly. I went with a combination of Dijkstra and DFS as my approach. For the second part I was a little lazy and instead of simulating two characters, I compared all possible paths, which does not scale very well, but for the provided input the program runs very fast.                                                                                                     |

| **Ideas for improvement** | - I've used a lot of different fields and arrays, which can probably be reduced<br/>- For the second part the path comparison algorithms can be optimized without the need to filter by ordering the paths in decending order. Once a match has been found the algorithm can complete without the need to search the remaining paths.<br />- An even better solution for the second part would have been to simulate two actors, but this would mean larger refactorings to the existing code base |

| **Comment**               | Very fun puzzle. Unfortunately, I tried to solve the puzzle by following the instructions very literally and by implementing visual aids. It took me a while until I got it right for the given example. But then I had a first look at the actual input and my solution did not scale well enough :( So everything back to start! I think I provided a good solution for the first part of the puzzle. However for the second part I feel like there should be a tweak that I was missing. While the coding was fun, it felt a little bit frustrating of having to start from scratch again... |

For the second part of the puzzle there might be a better way of reducing the solution space without iterating through all y-coordinates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Comment**               | Very fun and visual puzzle. The input file was easy to parse.

| **Ideas for improvement** | - My solution contains a static allocation for the cave size, which includes a little unneeded buffer to the left and right. To not allocate that much storage and to adjust dynamically to different input, it would have been great to allocate space in the cave only if needed (especially for part 2 of the puzzle)<br />- The printed image of the cave is very large, it would have been awesome not to print the whole image all the time, but only an extract around the moving sand. Then "updating" the image instead of generating a new one all the time |

It also took me a lot of time to understand all the rules completely and my solution does feel a lot more complicated than it should have been. In general I did not like this puzzle that much, the idea was very abstract and not so fun to code in my opinion. |

| **Puzzle summary**        | Monkeys playing a little game with the equipment.

| **Comment**               | There was a lot of different input to parse for this puzzle. However, the difficulty was to keep the processed numbers manageable as they became too large to store them in int64 variables. The numbers can be reduced by using a modulo operation. Took me quite some time to solve this puzzle and my solution still looks a little messy. |

| **Comment**               | I like this puzzle a lot, since it remembers me of the game "Snake". I'm moving each knot of the rope one after another. I'm happy with my solution, it is not much code and easy to read. |

| **Puzzle summary**        | First time the diffulty has increased a bit. Lists of characters need to be compared and priorities calculated based on character values (higher values for characters late in the alphabet). |
